# RCNN Project

This project implements a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) for object detection. RCNN is a popular method in computer vision for detecting objects in images by combining region proposals with convolutional neural networks.Due to some computational limits this model is not trained on specific dataset for rcnn's like coco dataset.However it is trained on small dataset of leaves.some changes in regionnetwork model required for proper functioning written in comments of code.
